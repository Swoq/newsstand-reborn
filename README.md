<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Overview

### About the project

The client-oriented E-Commerce project. Domain knowledge - periodical publications. The system has a list of
publications that grouped by topic.

A reader can subscribe to one or more publications. An User registers in the system and has a personal account, which
displays information about publications to which he is subscribed. An unregistered user cannot subscribe. The reader has
a personal account that he can replenish. Money are withdrawn from the account under time to subscribe to the
publication.

For a list of publications there are the possibilities:

- sorting publications by title, price, publication date;
- samples of publications on a particular genre or publisher;
- search for a publication by title.

Each of the publication has its own page with detailed information about it and rates to subscribe as well.

The system administrator has the rights to: adding, deleting and editing publications; blocking, unlocking the user. In
additional users with administrator rights can add new periods for subscriptions if no one from existed meets the
requirements.
